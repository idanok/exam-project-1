                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos.Our fantastic
                exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
                sky and what we can see and know about the universe
                around us. We’ll locate the various constellations
                and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
                the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early
                Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest

                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists
                    have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                    Where do we come from and how did we get here?
                    Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
                    we have had a framework for exploring and
                    understanding our place in this world.</p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet
                        and how the species we know today have evolved
                        our time. You can also take some time to meet
                        a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,
                        including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and
                        a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body,
                    major breakthroughs in biology are offering
                    us unique insights into the great wonders of
                    the tiny world.</p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much
                    longer and their quality of life much improved,
                    thanks to the growth of our understanding of
                    medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                    history of medicine and take a look at some major
                    breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
                    and the first heart transplant. </p>
                <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have
                    come not only from the lab, but also from
                    observing animals in the wild. Often our
                    fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                    the science of the future. From useful

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact
                    humans are having on the planet, the more
                    important it becomes that scientists explore
                    how to create a sustainable future not just
                    for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we
                    unpack the dangers we currently face including
                    global warming, extinction of species, and
                    pollution. But we also focus on the positive
                    ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>

        <h3>Visiting Professor of Aeronautics</h3>
        <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof
            Sheila Widnall from the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology will be delivering 3
            lectures on the development of aeronautics and where
            the future lies in this exciting ‘space’.</p>
        <h3>Night in the Museum</h3>
        <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in
            the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and
            science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and
            get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders
            of science.</p>
        <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam,
            the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that
            allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
            as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting,
            to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use
            and control wind to create power.</p>
